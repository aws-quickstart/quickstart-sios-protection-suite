== Test the deployment

To test the deployment, check that the full stack has been created successfully and
that the `lcdstatus` command reports that failover is allowed for all resources.

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation[AWS CloudFormation console^].
. Select the correct Region from the top toolbar.
. On the *Stacks* page, look for a status of `CREATE_FAILED`. 
. Choose the stack name.
. On the *Stack details* page, choose the *Events* tab. Find the explanation for the failed status in the *Status reason* column.
. Fix errors with the stack. For help, see https://docs.us.sios.com/spslinux/current/en/topic/troubleshooting[Troubleshooting^] or see https://support.us.sios.com/aspx/SupportHome[SIOS Support^]. Contact https://us.sios.com/about/contact-us/[SIOS pre-sales support^] during an evaluation period.
. After all stacks have a status of `CREATE COMPLETE`, open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1[Amazon EC2 console^].
. Log in to either the bastion host or the optional Windows jump server. Follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-connect-to-instance-linux[AWS guidelines^] for connecting to your instances.
. From the jump server node, use SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to the instance in the first Availability Zone.
. Run `sudo /opt/LifeKeeper/bin/lcdstatus`.
. The output should contain two resources: `/opt/sample_mirror` and `datarep-sample`. Both resources should report `FAILOVER ALLOWED`. Two known machines should be listed and reported as `ALIVE`.
