.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/sios-protection-suite-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Linux bastion hosts in an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Auto Scaling group to allow inbound SSH (Secure Shell) access to Amazon EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, two cluster nodes featuring SIOS Protection Suite for Linux.
* Amazon CloudWatch log groups to monitor, store, and access log files from EC2 instances.
* AWS Systems Manager runbook to automate the deployment.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
